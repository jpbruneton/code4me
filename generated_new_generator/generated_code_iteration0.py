e your code, the main considerations involve modularity, clarity, and robustness. Here’s a revised version that aims to achieve these goals, done with a focus on improving the existing logic and structure to better support extensibility and potential future enhancements.

### Key design improvements:
1. **Modularity and Encapsulation**:
   - Introduce a `ChatGPTInterface` for handling interactions with the API.
   - Consolidate project logic into a single `Project` class to encapsulate state and behavior related to the task.
   - Simplify API interaction by housing it within a dedicated class.

2. **Iterative Design and Code Feedback**:
   - Implement a loop mechanism to allow for multiple rounds of design improvements.
   - Add separation of concerns by ensuring code generation logic follows the completed design process distinctly.

3. **Project Lifecycle Management**:
   - Use method `run()` to consolidate key process steps for clarity: initial design, review loops, and subsequent refinement steps.
   - Integrated file management into `Project` to handle storing design and code versions efficiently.

This improved version focuses on using structured programming paradigms to handle complex processes, simplify the logical flow, and ensure that future extensions or modifications remain manageab

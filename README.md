## Auto-gpt like project for code only

Required openai APIkey 

The goal is to automatically generate comprehensive code based on a single prompt from the user. The process begins by making multiple calls to a large language model, such as ChatGPT. First, the model creates a detailed design to meet the user’s requirements. Next, the design is broken down into smaller components, and the code for each part is generated step by step. After each step, another call is made to critique the initial design and code, suggesting improvements and refining the solution until it’s fully optimized.

Displayed example : automatic coding of a space invador game, and of a IMDB like website

#todo : run it to see if it works more or less ; add unit tests ; check every functions, etc

## Just for the fun :)
